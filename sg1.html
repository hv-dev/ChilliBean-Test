            <p class="p">
                The story of Stargate SG-1 begins about a year after the events of the feature film when the United States government learns that an ancient alien device called the Stargate can access a network of such devices on a multitude of planets and in space. SG-1 is an elite United States Air Force special operations team, one of about 20 teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats such as the Goa'uld, the Replicators and the Ori. The series draws upon Egyptian, Greek and Norse mythology, as well as the legend of King Arthur.
                <br><br>
                The series was a ratings success for its first-run broadcasters and in syndication, and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. Stargate SG-1 was honored with numerous awards and award nominations in its ten-season run. It also spawned the animated television series Stargate Infinity, the live-action spin-off TV series Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, and Stargate Origins and the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum.

            <p class="p">
                The 1990's was a mediocre time for sci-fi series in my opinion. Stargate SG-1 was one of the few good series.
                <br>
                Like so many good shows what helped Stargate SG-1 was it's awesome cast; 
                Richard Dean Anderson as Col. O' Neill, Amanda Tapping as Captain/Major Carter, Michael Shanks as Dr. Jackson, Don S. Davis as Major General Hammond and Christopher Judge as Teal'c.
                <br><br>
                All the characters are brilliant. The chemistry between them is great. 
                Some of the Stargate SG-1 plots have been a little bit weak but you wouldn't notice because of the brilliant cast. 
                The SG-1 team kind of remind me of Doctor Who as they are often faced with complex moral issues.
                <br><br>
                The villains in this series could rival many of the villains from Star Trek. 
                We have had the SG-1 team fighting the likes of the G'ouald and the replicators. 
                The storylines have been consistently good throughout.
                <br><br>
                All in all, this is a great series. 
                My only criticism is the fact that the talented Teryl Rothery who plays Dr. Frasier hasn't had any good storylines of her own.
