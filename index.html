                Stargate is a military science fiction media franchise based on the film Stargate which released in 1994.
                The Stargate itself is a ring-shaped device which was created by the first evolution of the human form known
                as 'The Ancients'. 
                <br><br>
                Stargate primarily consists of 3 TV-Shows, 2 movies, and 1 web-series. This site will not cover the web-series
                as many (including myself) were not fond of it.
