            <p class="index-p">
                Stargate is a military science fiction media franchise based on the film Stargate which released in 1994.
                The Stargate itself is a ring-shaped device which was created by the first evolution of the human form known
                as 'The Ancients'. 
                <br><br>
                Stargate primarily consists of 3 TV-Shows, 2 movies, and 1 web-series. This site will not cover the web-series.
                <br><br>
                As all shows exist within the same universe, there is some crossover between them both cronologically and with guest appearances in the various shows.

            <h1 class="index-h1">Whats to love about the Stargate franchise?</h2>
            <p class="index-p">
                I could go on all day about why I love Stargate, but rather than bore you with an essay of reasoning I decided
                to ask the community of r/Stargate why they loved it so much so that I could share a wide range of opinions.
                <br><br>
                Below are just a few of the replies I received:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>"it delves into the historical and cultural knowledge of many of the extinct civilizations that once lived on this planet"</li>
                    <li>"The team dynamic is a constant thrill"</li>
                    <li>"nearly every olution to the show can be found through some logic or reason"</li>
                    <li>"The way it mixed science with mythology and philosophy, and explroes not just ancient cultures and their origins"</li>
                    <li>"I really like the 'ten minutes in the future' setting, which isn't something you really see in hard sci-fi."</li>
                    <li>"Stargate isn't afraid to make fun of itself. 200 and Wormhole X-Treme are perfect examples"</li>
                    <li>"Its more SCIENCE fiction than science FICTION like most other shows"</li>
                    <li>"As a Historian, I love the history and mythology aspect of Stargate. The characters are pretty damn likeable as well."</li>
                </ul>
