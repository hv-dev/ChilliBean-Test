            <p class="p">
                An attack on a secret off-world base by a rebel organisation has stranded the remaining survivors on an Ancient ship "Destiny",
                a large unmanned ship launched millions of years ago. 
                At the far end of the universe, Colonel Everett Young and Dr. Nicolas Rush now lead the new "Destiny" crew on a journey to discovering new worlds as well as encountering new alien creatures, 
                in hope of finding a way back home. 
                Morals are tested and tensions rise when Colonel Young's leadership is questioned all while Dr. Rush sacrifices the safety of the crew to pursue his own scientific ambitions. 
                Along the way, they make new enemies and clash with old familiar ones, as they uncover the mystery behind Destiny's true purpose

            <p class="p">
                This series' reputation suffered greatly from audience expectation that it would follow the same episode structure as previous iterations of the Stargate franchise. 
                SG-1 and Atlantis enjoyed long story arcs and changing paradigms, but primarily the viewing experience was full-story-encapsulated episodes like most prime time programs. 
                Other than a handful of key episodes over the lifetime of the SG-1, a viewer could watch the episodes in any order. 
                Atlantis was more long-arc driven but still mostly episodic. 
                Universe, however, was far more serial; that is, long arcs drove the storylines and the program needed to be seen in order. 
                Each episode was a chapter in a book rather than a short story in a collection of many short stories. 
                There's good reason that reviews improve over the lifetime of SG:Universe as viewers that persisted realized how impressive the plots and acting really were.
